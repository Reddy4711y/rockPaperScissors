# rockPaperScissors
This is my first simple project.
Instructions

Make a rock, paper, scissors game. 

Start the game by asking the player:

*"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*

From there you will need to figure out: 
* How you will store the user's input.
* How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
* How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
* And also how you will give feedback to the player.



#RULES:3 simple rules: Rock wins against scissors. Scissors win against paper.and paper
wins against rock.

####### Debugging challenge: #########
#Try running this code and type 5.
#It will give you an IndexError and point to line 32 as the issue.
#But on line 38 we are trying to prevent a crash by detecting
#any numbers great than or equal to 3 or less than 0.
#So what's going on?
This program will help you in better way that you can think in different way and also it will help you to improve your debugging skills.
so you can think like a code developer and also find the bugs while you do some beginner to advance projects.
